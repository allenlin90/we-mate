## Questions
### Short term and cost on acquisition
1. What is customer persona? Who will want to use this app?
2. What are the strategies for user acquiring?
3. People at the place can just go approaching strangers. Why using this app for extra step?
4. People want to send treats can just ask the helper as the middleman. Why using this app?
5. Why should people use this app after they've meet? They can exchange connection the other social apps (e.g. IG, TikTok, LINE, WhatsApp).

### Long term
1. People who want to practice social activities can be shy at first but after they get used to it, this app will not be useful.

### Monetization
1. How does this app make profit?

### Maintenance costs
1. Software development and maintenance
2. Software hosting costs
3. Service subscription
4. Loyalty to partners
